'''
The graph is represented as an adjacency list using
a dictionary, where the key is the source node and
the value is another dictionary, where the keys
are neigbor vertices and the values are the edge weights
to each vertex, e.g.

{
    source_vertex1 : {neighbor1: weight1, neighbor2: weight2}
    source_vertex2 : . . .
    . . .
}
